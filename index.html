    <h1>SUCHETGARH BORDER</h1>
    <p>
      Suchetgarh border post, has been developed as a tourism spot by the state
      tourism department. The Suchetgarh Border post is 28 kms from main Jammu.
      The road to Nai Basti-Gulabgarh from Jammu follows the train route as it
      existed prior to 1947 and a number of old buildings can be seen on the
      way.

        Suchetgarh Post served as the route to Sialkot during the pre-partition
        era, which is just 11 kms from the post and earlier there was an Octroi
        post at this point. On the other side of the border post lies a
        spectacular Banyan Tree, which is as old as 100 years. In close vicinity
        are the "Gharana and Abdullian wet lands where migratory birds of a
        number of varieties flock during winter season.
